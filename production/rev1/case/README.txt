To build a minimal case with a stand, cut from a 3mm thick sheet:

1 x bottom
1 x stand
2 x top

Use < 10mm screws to connect the feet to the bottom or else they might break.
Try to use flat head screws for the top as to not have them graze the hands while typing.

The height is just enough to use wrist rests very comfortably.
